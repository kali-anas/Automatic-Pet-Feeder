## Overview

The WiFi-Connected Animal Feeding System leverages Arduino microcontrollers and 3D printing technologies to design and fabricate a model that automates the process of feeding animals. This advanced system incorporates WiFi connectivity, enabling remote control and monitoring of feeding schedules and quantities. Whether for pet care, livestock management, or wildlife conservation, our project offers a sophisticated solution for animal feeding.

## Project Features

- **Automated Feeding:** The system provides automated feeding of animals according to predefined schedules and quantities, ensuring consistent care and nutrition.

- **WiFi Connectivity:** WiFi-enabled microcontrollers allow remote control and monitoring of feeding parameters from anywhere with an internet connection.

- **Customizable Schedules:** Users can customize feeding schedules to cater to specific animal needs and dietary requirements.

- **Quantity Control:** Precise control over the amount of food dispensed helps prevent overfeeding or underfeeding.

- **3D-Printed Components:** We utilized 3D printing technologies to fabricate key components, ensuring durability and customization possibilities.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system provides real-time feedback on feeding activities, allowing users to stay informed about their animals' well-being.

## Technologies Used

Our project incorporates the following technologies:

- **Arduino Microcontrollers:** Arduino boards serve as the core hardware for controlling feeding mechanisms.

- **WiFi Connectivity:** We utilize WiFi modules to enable remote communication and control via smartphone or computer.

- **3D Printing:** 3D printing technology is employed to fabricate custom parts, including feeders and housings.

- **Sensors:** Various sensors are integrated to monitor factors such as food levels and animal presence.

## How it Works

1. **Automated Feeding:** The system's schedule and quantity parameters are set by the user via a user-friendly interface.

2. **Remote Control:** Users can monitor and control the feeding system remotely through a smartphone app or web interface.

3. **Real-time Feedback:** Sensors provide real-time data on food levels, animal presence, and feeding activities.

4. **Dispensing Mechanism:** The system dispenses food at scheduled intervals and quantities, ensuring animals receive the right amount of nutrition.

## Usage

To use the WiFi-Connected Animal Feeding System:

1. Clone the project repository to access the code and design files.

2. Assemble the hardware components and 3D-printed parts according to the provided instructions.

3. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontrollers.
